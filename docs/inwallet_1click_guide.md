> Do not close wallet till you see "Finished" - SINOVATE setUP is now complete. Depending on block confirmation speed, invoice payment, and the SIN coin burning process will automatically take between 3 and 10 minutes, up to 55 blocks.

Check the transactions History of your wallet. Your node will automatically be up and running in around 10 to 15 minutes after the confirmations.

  

It really is that simple; with just a few clicks, would-be network participants will earn considerable passive income for up to a year. In addition, the SINOVATE setUP provides the perfect opportunity to reassess your VPS needs at competitive prices paid in SIN for community members who have previously set up an infinity node.
