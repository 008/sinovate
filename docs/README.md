**SINOVATE (SIN)** is an open-source state of the art digital cryptocurrency. We create and build
innovative blockchain services for individuals, developers, and enterprises. Decentralized cloud (dCloud), SINCORD messenger
proof-of-integrity, proof-of-inheritance, and blockchain-based file transfer protocol, bFTP are some of the resolutions presented to the crypto space.

# Features and Innovations

 - **X25X** GPU Algorithm. Leading-edge, in-house built,custom GPU mining algorithm. More complex,less power-hungry.
 - **Deterministic InfinityNodes** Explicitly designed to overcome the hyperinflation all cryptocurrency projects face. InfinityNodes burn the collateral with unprecedented network security, speed and stability.
 - **NEPHELE:Incorruptible Data Storage** Blockchain-mail, Proof-of-Integrity. SINCORD messenger, proof-of-inheritance, blockchain-based file transfer protocol, bFTP and unlimited private networking of big data storage.

SINOVATE (SIN) combines its brand new **X25X Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm with LWMA difficulty retargeting algorithm, Reorg fork reject solution merged with P.O.B., and PoS4 establish a triple security 51% attack protection.

X25X is  GPU mineable and ensures temporary **ASIC, FPGA and QUANTUM resistance**,  solidifying the decentralised consensus mechanism in the process.
